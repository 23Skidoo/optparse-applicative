## Version 0.2.2 (unreleased)

- Parser is now an instance of Alternative. This makes it possible to build
certain complex parsers that were not definable before. See
`tests/Examples/Alternatives.hs` for a simple example.

- Removed `multi` modifier. You can now use the `many` or `some` methods from
`Alternative`, instead, to create parsers for options that can appear more than
once.

- Added new `flag'` builder that returns a flag without a default value.
Although flags without default values were not useful before, with the addition
of `Alternative` combinators, they do have valid use cases.

- Added new `internal` modifier for options. An internal option is completely
invisible in the help text.

    * \#6 - "arguments" swallows options
