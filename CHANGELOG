## Version 0.3.0 (30 Jul 2012)

- Option modifiers are now instances of `Monoid` instead of `Category`.

- Dropped dependencies on data-default and data-lens.

- Fixed bugs
    * \#14 - "arguments" can no longer take a list as a default

## Version 0.2.0 (23 Jul 2012)

- Parser is now an instance of Alternative. This makes it possible to build
certain complex parsers that were not definable before. See
`tests/Examples/Alternatives.hs` for a simple example.

- Removed `multi` modifier. You can now use the `many` or `some` methods from
`Alternative`, instead, to create parsers for options that can appear more than
once.

- Added new `flag'` builder that returns a flag without a default value.
Although flags without default values were not useful before, with the addition
of `Alternative` combinators, they do have valid use cases.

- Added new `internal` modifier for options. An internal option is completely
invisible in the help text.

- Added a new `customExecParser` function, which takes an additional
`ParserPrefs` parameter. At the moment, `ParserPrefs` can only be used to
control how many-valued option metavars are displayed in the help text. Setting
its `multiSuffix` field to e.g. `...` will result in an `arguments` parser
description like `[METAVAR]...`.

- Fixed bugs
    * \#6 - "arguments" swallows options
    * \#5 - Help formatting for "arguments" misleading

## Version 0.1.1 (21 Jul 2012)
